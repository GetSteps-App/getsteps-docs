App Lock uses Apple's Screen Time to block selected apps until you hit your daily step goal, helping you stay active before screen time.

<Note>App Lock is a Pro feature.</Note>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable App Lock">
    Go to **Settings > App Lock** and turn it on. Steps will request Screen Time authorization.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Apps to Lock">
    Pick the apps and app categories you want to block using Apple's app picker. Social media, games, and entertainment apps are popular choices.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Walk to Unlock">
    Locked apps are blocked with a shield until you reach your daily step goal. Once you hit your target, all selected apps unlock automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Daily Reset

App Lock resets at **midnight** every day. This means:

- Shields are re-applied at the start of each new day
- Once apps are unlocked, they stay unlocked until midnight — even if you change your goal
- You start fresh each morning

## Progress Messages

While apps are locked, you'll see progress messages encouraging you to keep walking. When you reach your goal, an **"Apps Unlocked!"** notification lets you know.

## Mid-Day Goal Changes

- If you **lower** your goal and your current steps already exceed it, apps unlock immediately
- If you **raise** your goal, apps remain locked until you reach the new target

<Warning>App Lock requires Screen Time authorization. If you deny the permission, you'll need to grant it in your device's Screen Time settings to use this feature.</Warning>

Steps reads the following data from Apple Health:

- **Steps** - Your daily step count
- **Walking + Running Distance** - Distance covered on foot
- **Active Energy Burned** - Calories burned through activity
- **Flights Climbed** - Floors you've climbed
- **Heart Rate** - Used during workouts
- **Workout Routes** - GPS routes for your recorded workouts

<Tip>Steps never writes to or modifies your Apple Health data. It only reads your existing activity information.</Tip>

## Privacy

Your health data stays on your device. Steps does not upload your fitness data to any server. All processing happens locally on your iPhone.

## Re-syncing Health Data

If your step count looks incorrect or data appears missing, you can re-sync from Apple Health:

1. Open **Settings** in Steps
2. Scroll to the Support section
3. Tap **Re-sync Apple Health data**

This refreshes all your activity data from Apple Health.

## Restart Onboarding

To go through the setup flow again:

1. Open **Settings** in Steps
2. Tap **Restart Onboarding**
3. Confirm when prompted

This lets you reconfigure your daily goal and permissions.

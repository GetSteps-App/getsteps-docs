Streaks track how many consecutive days you've reached your daily step goal. The longer your streak, the higher the badge tier you earn.

## How Streaks Work

Each day you meet your step goal counts toward your streak. Miss a day and your streak resets to zero. Your current streak is shown on the Home Dashboard with a flame icon.

Earn progressively higher badges as your streak grows:

|-------|------|------|
| **Bronze** | 7 days | Shield |
| **Silver** | 14 days | Star medal |
| **Gold** | 30 days | Crown |
| **Platinum** | 60 days | Hexagonal star |
| **Emerald** | 100 days | Laurel wreath |
| **Ruby** | 200 days | Gem |
| **Diamond** | 365 days | Diamond |

<Tip>The Diamond badge features a special prismatic rainbow effect to celebrate a full year of consistency.</Tip>

## 30-Day Heatmap

The streak detail view shows a 30-day heatmap of your recent activity. Each day is color-coded based on whether you met your goal, giving you a quick visual of your consistency.

## Streak Stats

Your streak detail view also shows:

- **Current Streak** - Your active consecutive day count
- **Best Streak** - Your longest streak ever
- **Next Badge** - The badge tier you're working toward and days remaining

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What counts as completing a day?">
    Reaching your daily step goal at any point during the day counts. Steps sync from Apple Health, so all steps from your iPhone and Apple Watch are included.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does changing my goal affect my streak?">
    Your streak is based on the goal set for each day. If you lower your goal and your steps already exceed it, that day counts. Raising your goal mid-day means you need to hit the new target.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I recover a lost streak?">
    No, streaks reset when you miss a day. But your best streak is always saved, so you can try to beat your record.

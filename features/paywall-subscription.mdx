## Overview

Steps Pro unlocks the full set of premium features through a subscription or one-time lifetime purchase. The upgrade screen is accessible from the "Get Steps Pro" card in Settings, from any Pro-gated feature, and from the "View Plans" row for existing subscribers.

## User Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Feature Showcase">
    The top of the screen auto-scrolls through 8 feature cards every 5 seconds, giving you a live preview of everything included in Pro — charts, workout analytics, Apple Watch, widgets, notifications, route maps, colour themes, and App Lock.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Plan">
    Three pricing options are listed below the feature cards. Tap any plan to select it, then tap "Continue" to purchase.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Purchase & Confirm">
    The standard iOS purchase flow runs. Once complete, a success message appears and the paywall closes — your Pro features are active immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restore a Purchase">
    If you've previously subscribed, tap "Restore Purchase" to reactivate Pro on a new device or after reinstalling.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Plans

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="7-Day Free Trial" icon="gift">
    Start free, then billed monthly. The most flexible way to try Pro — cancel any time before the trial ends and you won't be charged.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pro Yearly" icon="calendar">
    Billed once a year at a significant discount compared to monthly. A "SAVE X%" chip shows the exact savings. This is the most popular option.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lifetime" icon="infinity">
    A single one-time purchase for permanent Pro access. No recurring charges, ever.
  </Card>

Individual and family plan variants are available — tap "Switch to family plans" at the bottom of the screen to see family pricing.

## Overview

The monthly steps chart gives you a bird's-eye view of your activity for a full calendar month. Each bar represents one day, so you can immediately spot active stretches, rest days, and how your overall month shaped up.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Full Month Bar Chart">
    Up to 31 bars appear — one per calendar day in the selected month. Days with no recorded data (such as future dates) render as invisible zero-height bars, keeping the axis consistent and full-width.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Goal Color Coding">
    Each bar is independently colored based on whether you met your step goal on that day. Green means goal achieved; blue means not yet. The app checks the goal that was active on each specific date, honoring any goal changes you made during the month.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tap to Select a Day">
    Tap any bar with recorded steps to select it. The selected bar highlights with a stroke outline while the others dim to 30% opacity. The step count card above updates instantly to show that day's detailed stats — steps, distance, calories, and flights climbed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deselect">
    Tap the same bar again to deselect it. All bars return to full opacity and the card reverts to showing the month's overall data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Axis Labels">
    The horizontal axis shows day numbers at position 1 and every 5th day (1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30). The selected day's label appears bold. The vertical axis abbreviates thousands with "K".
  </Accordion>

<Tip>Combine the monthly chart with the sum/average toggle on the step count card to see both your monthly total and your daily average for the month.</Tip>

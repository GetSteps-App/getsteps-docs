## Overview

The horizontal calendar strip sits at the bottom of the home screen. It lets you scroll through and select any date, week, or month. The strip automatically adapts its content based on which view mode you have active — Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Mode">
    Each item shows an abbreviated weekday name (e.g., "Mon") and the day number. When the day is the first of a month, the month number is appended (e.g., "1/6") so you always know when a new month begins. The strip covers the past 120 days.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weekly Mode">
    Each item shows the abbreviated month and a compact date range (e.g., "Jun 15-21"). The strip covers the past 52 weeks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monthly Mode">
    Each item shows the year and abbreviated month name. The strip covers the past 12 months.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Selecting a Period">
    Tap any item to select it. The selected item gets a rounded-rectangle background highlight. The step count card and chart above immediately update to reflect the data for that period.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Goal Indicators">
    When a daily step goal is set, a small filled circle appears in the top-right corner of items where the goal was achieved. In Weekly and Monthly modes, the dot reflects whether the combined steps for that entire period met the combined goals across all days in it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>The strip automatically scrolls to keep your selected item centered. After switching between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly modes, the strip repositions itself to the current period.</Tip>

## Automatic Updates

A significant time change — such as midnight rolling over to a new day — causes the strip to rebuild itself so today's slot is always present and selectable.

## Availability

The calendar strip is available to all users in Daily mode. Weekly and Monthly strip content requires a Steps Pro subscription, since those view modes are Pro-only.

Steps Pro unlocks advanced features across the app. Subscriptions are managed through Apple's standard in-app purchase system, powered by RevenueCat, so your purchase history is always tied to your Apple ID and can be restored at any time.

## Purchasing & Restoring

- Open the paywall inside the app to see current pricing and available plans.
- Tap a plan to purchase — you'll be prompted by Apple's standard payment sheet.
- Pro features unlock immediately after a successful purchase.
- If you've previously subscribed or purchased, tap **Restore Purchases** to re-activate your entitlement on any device signed in to the same Apple ID, at no extra charge.

## Family Sharing

Steps Pro is available as a family sharing plan, allowing everyone in your Apple Family Sharing group to enjoy Pro features under a single subscription.

## Managing Your Subscription

To cancel, change, or view your subscription:

1. Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
2. Tap your name at the top, then tap **Subscriptions**.
3. Find **Steps** and make any changes there.

Alternatively, the app provides a direct link to your Apple subscription management page from within the Pro settings screen.

<Note>
  Pro status is restored automatically when you sign in to the app on a new device using the same Apple ID. Use **Restore Purchases** if the status does not update immediately.

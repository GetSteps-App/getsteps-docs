## Overview

Goal Setting lets you configure an optional daily step target. You can enable or disable the goal at any time, pick your target from a range of 1,000 to 20,000 steps, and see an estimated distance equivalent update in real time as you scroll.

It's accessible from Settings ("Daily goal" row) and is also part of the initial onboarding flow when you first set up the app.

## User Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Goal Settings">
    Go to Settings and tap "Daily goal". A sheet slides up showing your current goal configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable or Disable">
    An "Enable Daily Goal" toggle sits at the top. When turned off, the goal picker and related UI are hidden with a smooth animation. When turned on, three additional sections appear below.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Your Target">
    A wheel picker lets you scroll through values from 1,000 to 20,000 steps in increments of 500. Your current goal is shown in a large bold number above the picker, animating smoothly as you scroll.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview Distance">
    Below the picker, an estimated distance equivalent updates in real time — shown in km or miles depending on your unit system preference.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Milestone Card">
    A contextual milestone card below the picker shows motivational feedback based on your chosen target, changing colour and message as you scroll through ranges.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When you close the sheet, any changes take effect immediately — your progress calculation updates, widgets reload, and your Apple Watch companion syncs with the new goal.

## How It Works

### Milestone Ranges

The milestone card changes as you adjust your goal, giving you motivational context for each target level:

| Goal Range | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 1,000 – 2,999 steps | Getting Started! 🌱 |
| 3,000 – 4,999 steps | Building Momentum! 💪 |
| 5,000 – 7,999 steps | Good Daily Habit! ⭐ |
| 8,000 – 9,999 steps | Active Lifestyle! 🚀 |
| 10,000 – 12,999 steps | Excellent Goal! 🎯 |
| 13,000 – 15,999 steps | High Achiever! 🏆 |
| 16,000 – 20,000 steps | Athletic Performance! 🥇 |

<Tip>
  The estimated distance below the picker updates instantly as you scroll — it's a great way to get a feel for how far your goal actually is each day.

<Note>
  If you lower your goal below your current step count for the day while App Lock is enabled, the app will automatically evaluate whether to unlock your selected apps right away.

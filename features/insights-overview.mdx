## Overview

The Insights screen is your personal yearly fitness recap. It pulls together your step and workout activity for the selected year and presents everything as a beautifully styled, scrollable summary — with receipt-style cards, charts, and motivational callouts.

Switch between years using the year picker in the top toolbar. Everything updates instantly with a smooth animation.

## User Experience

When you open the Insights tab for the first time, a brief intro sheet welcomes you to the feature. After that, each visit takes you straight to your yearly summary.

The screen scrolls through a rich sequence of sections:

1. **Steps section** — your walking stats for the year, starting with the Yearly Receipt card.
2. **Daily Average & Best Day** — two quick-glance metric cards side by side.
3. **Weekday Breakdown** — an animated bar chart showing which days of the week you walk the most, plus a weekday vs. weekend comparison bar.
4. **Best Month, Peak Hour, Goal Met, Best Streak** — four metric tiles in a 2×2 grid highlighting your top achievements.
5. **Fun Equivalents** — creative comparisons that put your steps into perspective (distance, calories, CO₂ saved, body fat burned).
6. **Workouts section** _(appears only if you logged at least one workout)_:
   - Workout Flight Ticket summarising your yearly workout totals.
   - Workout Breakdown with a pie chart and indoor/outdoor split.
   - Personal Records — your best performances across 8 categories, with a live map of each workout route.
   - Workout Fun Equivalents comparing your total workout time and distance.
7. **Passport Stamp** — a decorative stamp showing your year as "COMPLETE" or "AWAITS".
8. **Motivational Sign-Off** — a closing message personalised to your activity level.

## Overview

QR Code Sharing lets you share the Steps app with anyone via a scannable QR code or a direct App Store link. It's accessible from the "Share Steps" row in Settings and generates a high-quality QR code entirely on-device with your current app icon embedded in the centre.

## User Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Share Sheet">
    In Settings, tap "Share Steps". A half-height sheet appears with a thin material background.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan or Copy">
    A 300×300pt white rounded card displays the generated QR code. While the QR is being generated, a spinner is shown briefly. Once ready, anyone can scan it with their camera to go straight to the App Store listing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy QR Code">
    Tap "Copy QR Code" to copy the QR image to your clipboard so you can paste it into a message, post, or document. A "Image copied" toast confirms the action.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Link">
    Tap "Copy Link" to copy the direct App Store URL to your clipboard. A "Link copied" toast confirms the action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The QR code automatically regenerates when your device switches between light and dark mode, keeping the colours correct at all times.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="On-Device Generation" icon="lock">
    The QR code is generated entirely on your device — no network request is made. It uses circular pixel and eye shapes for a polished look.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Icon Embedded" icon="image">
    Your currently selected app icon is centred inside the QR code, so it's immediately recognisable as a Steps share.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Resolution" icon="expand">
    The QR is generated at print quality (1024pt × screen scale, 300 DPI), so it looks sharp whether shared digitally or printed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Light & Dark Mode" icon="circle-half-stroke">
    The QR code colours adapt automatically — black-on-white in light mode, white-on-black in dark mode.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  The copied QR image is high-resolution and suitable for printing, posting on social media, or embedding in a presentation.

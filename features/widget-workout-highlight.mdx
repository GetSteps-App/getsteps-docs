The Workout Highlight widget cycles through five different workout highlight categories, surfacing one standout workout per hour on your Home Screen. Tapping the widget takes you directly to that workout's detail screen in the app.

## How It Works

The widget displays as a small Home Screen widget. An orange-gradient badge at the top shows the current highlight category. Below it, a colored icon circle identifies the workout type, followed by the workout name and a relative timestamp. A compact 2×2 metric grid shows Distance, Duration, Calories, and Average Pace.

## User Experience

- The widget rotates through all five categories automatically, showing a new highlight each hour.
- The accent color for the icon circle and background gradient matches the workout type: running is purple, cycling is green, walking is blue, hiking is brown.
- The timestamp shows "Today" for workouts completed today, or the date for older workouts.
- Tapping the widget deep-links directly to that specific workout's detail screen in the app.
- If you haven't logged any workouts yet, the widget shows an empty state with a prompt to start your first workout.

<Note>
  Workout highlight data requires HealthKit access and at least one workout tracked by the app. The widget itself has no subscription gating.

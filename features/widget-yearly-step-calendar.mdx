The Yearly Step Calendar widget displays an 18×21 grid of tiny cells — one per day of the year — color-coded by activity level. It also surfaces your current streak, total days you reached your goal, and your average daily steps for the year.

## How It Works

The widget renders as a large Home Screen widget. The header shows the current year on the left and your current streak count with a flame icon on the right (hidden when streak is zero). The main area fills with a grid of small rounded cells representing every day from January 1 through December 31, read left-to-right and top-to-bottom. A footer row shows days goal reached and average steps per active day.

## User Experience

- **No data** — cell appears as gray at 10% opacity.
- **Partial progress** — cell fills with the "in progress" color at proportional opacity (minimum 20% so low-activity days are still visible).
- **Goal reached** — cell shows a solid "goal completed" color (or solid "in progress" if goal tracking is disabled).
- The streak counter in the header updates daily as you maintain consecutive goal-met days.
- The footer stats give you a year-in-review snapshot: how many days you hit your target and what your typical active day looks like.
- The widget refreshes every 2 hours.

<Tip>
  The yearly grid is the best way to see long-term patterns — active seasons, vacation dips, and the satisfying visual of a solid color run when you're on a streak.

## Overview

Once you start a workout and the countdown finishes, the live session screen takes over. You get a real-time map tracing your route, a stats panel with live metrics, weather in the navigation bar, and simple controls to pause or end your session. Requires iOS 26 or later.

## User Experience

1. After the 3-second countdown, the live session screen appears.
2. The **top half** of the screen shows a live map centered on your current position. Your route traces behind you as a colored polyline.
3. A blue dot marks your current location. Tap the recenter button or compass to reposition the map.
4. The **bottom card** shows four live stats updated in real time:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Duration" icon="clock">
    Live elapsed time in MM:SS format, updating at up to 30 fps while the session is running. Pauses when you pause the workout.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Distance" icon="ruler">
    Cumulative distance in your preferred unit (km or miles), sourced live from HealthKit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Active Energy" icon="bolt">
    Kilocalories burned, updated live from HealthKit sensor data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pace / Speed / Heart Rate" icon="gauge-high">
    Varies by activity: **Pace** for running and walking, **Speed** for cycling, **Heart Rate** for hiking.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

5. Current **weather** (temperature and humidity) displays in the center of the navigation bar, refreshed every 5 minutes.
6. Use the navigation bar controls to manage your session:

| Button | When visible | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Pause | While running | Pauses the session, stops the timer and route collection |
| Resume | While paused | Resumes the session |
| End | While paused | Ends and saves the workout |

## Saving a Workout

Tap **End** while paused to finish your session. A "Saving workout" overlay appears while Steps finalizes your data with HealthKit. Once saved, the app takes you directly to your new workout's detail view.

<Note>
  If the app is closed mid-workout, Steps can recover your session when reopened. Your route data is preserved across app restarts.
</Note>

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Route Tracing" icon="route">
    Your GPS path is drawn as a gradient polyline in your workout type's color. The route is also persisted locally so it survives an unexpected app restart.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Live Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Metrics come directly from HealthKit's live workout builder. Pace and speed are smoothed with a 5-second update interval to prevent jitter from rapid sensor changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Weather" icon="cloud-sun">
    Weather is fetched via WeatherKit when the workout starts and refreshed automatically every 5 minutes during the session.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

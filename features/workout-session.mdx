Steps lets you record workouts with live tracking, GPS route mapping, and real-time stats directly from your iPhone.

## Workout Types

You can start four types of workouts, each with indoor and outdoor variants:

| Type | Variants | Color |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Walking** | Outdoor Walk, Indoor Walk | Blue |
| **Running** | Outdoor Run, Indoor Run | Purple |
| **Cycling** | Outdoor Cycle, Indoor Cycle | Green |
| **Hiking** | Outdoor only | Mint |

<Tip>Outdoor workouts record your GPS route on a map. Indoor workouts track duration, calories, and heart rate without GPS.</Tip>

During an outdoor workout, you'll see:

- **Live Map** - Your route drawn in real-time with the workout's color
- **Duration** - Elapsed time
- **Distance** - Total distance covered
- **Calories** - Active energy burned
- **Pace or Speed** - Walking/Running shows pace; Cycling shows speed; Hiking shows heart rate

Current weather (temperature and humidity) is displayed in the toolbar.

## Pause, Resume, and End

- Tap **Pause** to temporarily stop tracking
- Tap **Resume** to continue your workout
- Tap **End** (available when paused) to finish and save

## Live Activity

On iOS 26+, an active workout appears in the **Dynamic Island** and on your **Lock Screen**:

- The Dynamic Island cycles between calories, distance, and elapsed time every 30 seconds
- The expanded view shows distance, active energy, pace, and elapsed time

<Note>Live Activity for workouts requires iOS 26 or later.</Note>

## Auto-Detected Workouts

Steps also reads workouts recorded by Apple Health from other apps and your Apple Watch. These appear in your Activity List automatically, including types like swimming, yoga, HIIT, strength training, and more.

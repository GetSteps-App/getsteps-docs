The Live Workout Activity shows real-time workout metrics while a session is in progress. It appears automatically on your Lock Screen banner and in the Dynamic Island as soon as you start a workout in the app.

## How It Works

When you begin a workout, a Live Activity starts and stays visible until your session ends. All numeric values animate smoothly as they update. A green checkmark appears next to the workout name when you finish the session.

## Display Areas

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Lock Screen / StandBy" icon="lock">
    Shows the workout icon and name, an elapsed time counter, and a row of three metrics — Distance, Calories, and Pace (or Heart Rate for hiking workouts).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Island (Expanded)" icon="circle-dot">
    The leading region shows the workout icon in the workout's accent color. The trailing region shows elapsed time. The bottom region shows the Distance, Calories, and Pace row.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Dynamic Island (Compact)" icon="minus">
    The leading side shows the workout icon. The trailing side cycles every 30 seconds between calories, distance, and elapsed time with a smooth push animation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dynamic Island (Minimal)" icon="circle">
    Shows just the workout icon — ideal when another app is also using the Dynamic Island.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workout Colors

Each workout type has its own accent color throughout the Live Activity:

| Workout | Color |
|---------|-------|
| Running | Purple |
| Walking | Blue |
| Cycling | Green |
| Hiking | Mint |
| Others | App accent |

## User Experience

- The Live Activity starts automatically when you begin a workout in Steps — no manual action needed.
- Distance is shown in your preferred unit (km or miles).
- Hiking workouts show Heart Rate instead of Pace as the third metric.
- All metrics animate with numeric transitions as they update in real time.
- When you end the session, a green checkmark confirms the workout is complete.

<Note>
  Live Activities require iOS 16.1 or later. No Pro subscription is required — the Live Activity appears for all users during an active workout session.

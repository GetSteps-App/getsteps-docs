## Overview

The Yearly Receipt is the first card you see in the Insights screen. Styled to look like a physical paper receipt — complete with perforated edges and a dashed tear-line divider — it gives you a quick, satisfying summary of your total steps, distance, and calories for the selected year.

## User Experience

The receipt sits at the very top of the Insights scroll view, just below the "Steps" section header.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Header">
    The receipt opens with "👟 YOUR 2025 RECEIPT 👟" (or whichever year you've selected) in a monospaced headline font. The year updates instantly when you switch years in the toolbar picker.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Items">
    Three rows are listed like line items on a real receipt — STEPS, DISTANCE, and CALORIES — each with the label on the left and your value on the right. The values animate in with a smooth numeric count-up when you first open Insights.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Total">
    Instead of a monetary total, a rotating motivational message appears — things like "PRICELESS 💎", "BEYOND MEASURE 📈", "100% EARNED 💪", or "PURE GOLD 🥇". The message is selected based on your total step count so it varies naturally across different users and years.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Footer">
    A bold caption at the bottom reads "THANK YOU FOR WALKING ⭐".
  </Step>
</Steps>

The card has perforated scalloped edges at the top and bottom, internal dashed tear lines between sections, and a subtle drop shadow that gives it a slight lift off the background. The card colour adapts to your device's light or dark mode.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={3}>

  <Card title="Calories" icon="fire">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>

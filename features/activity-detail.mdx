## Overview

Tapping any workout in the Activity List opens a full-screen detail view. You'll see an interactive map with your route, a stats sheet with all recorded metrics, and — for Pro users — an animated playback that retraces your path in real time.

## User Experience

1. Tap any workout row in the Activity List. The detail view opens full-screen.
2. The **map** fills the screen and draws your route as a colored polyline. While the route loads, a spinner appears over a blurred background.
3. Once loaded, the map automatically frames your entire route with a clear view above the stats sheet.
4. A **stats sheet** slides up from the bottom showing:
   - Workout type, name (with Indoor/Outdoor prefix where applicable), date, and time.
   - Weather at the time of your workout (temperature and humidity), if recorded.
   - A grid of all available metrics for that session.
5. Tap the **Share** button (top-right toolbar) to open the sharing sheet.

<Note>
  On iOS 26 and later, the stats sheet uses a glass material effect. On earlier iOS versions it uses a translucent material.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Route Map" icon="route">
    Your GPS route is drawn as a colored polyline, color-coded by workout type. The map auto-positions to show your full route.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stats Grid" icon="table-cells">
    Duration and distance are always shown. Additional metrics like heart rate, pace, elevation, and energy appear when HealthKit data is available.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Elevation Profile" icon="chart-area">
    During playback, an elevation chart slides up showing altitude changes along your route, with min/max labels and a live position indicator.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Weather Data" icon="cloud-sun">
    If weather was recorded at workout time, the temperature and humidity appear in the stats header.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Route Playback

Pro users can replay their route as an animation directly on the map:

1. Tap the **Play** button in the toolbar (only visible when a route was recorded).
2. The stats sheet slides away and an elevation profile appears at the bottom.
3. A dot traces your path across the map — the animation scales from 10 to 30 seconds based on workout distance.
4. The elevation chart fills in progressively as the dot moves along the route.
5. Use **Pause / Resume** and **Reset** buttons in the toolbar to control playback.
6. Playback resets automatically one second after it completes.

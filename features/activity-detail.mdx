The Activity Detail view gives you a complete breakdown of any recorded workout, including your route, stats, and sharing options.

## Route Map

For outdoor workouts, a map displays your GPS route drawn in the workout's color. You can switch between:

- **Standard** map view
- **Satellite** imagery view

## Workout Stats

Every workout detail view shows:

- **Duration** - Total workout time
- **Distance** - Total distance covered
- **Pace** - Average pace (for walking and running)
- **Elevation Gain** - Total climb during the workout
- **Heart Rate** - Average and max heart rate
- **Calories** - Active energy burned
- **Weather** - Temperature and humidity during the workout

## Route Playback

<Note>Route playback is a Pro feature.</Note>

Replay your workout route on the map to see how you moved through your session. The playback animates your position along the route so you can relive the workout.

## Sharing Your Workout

Share your workout as a styled image. Steps offers four share styles:

| Style | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Transparent** | Stats on a transparent background |
| **Overlay** | Stats overlaid on your route map |
| **Frame** | Route map with a bordered stats frame |
| **Photo** | Stats overlaid on a photo from your library |

You can also choose from five aspect ratios: 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 3:4, and 9:16.

For map-based styles, additional options include map appearance (light/dark), point of interest visibility, and elevation style.

See [Sharing](/docs/features/sharing) for full details.

## GPX Export

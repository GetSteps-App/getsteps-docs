For outdoor workouts, a map displays your GPS route drawn in the workout's color. You can switch between:

- **Satellite** imagery view

## Workout Stats

Every workout detail view shows:

- **Duration** - Total workout time
- **Distance** - Total distance covered
- **Pace** - Average pace (for walking and running)
- **Elevation Gain** - Total climb during the workout
- **Heart Rate** - Average and max heart rate
- **Calories** - Active energy burned
- **Weather** - Temperature and humidity during the workout

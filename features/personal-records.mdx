## Overview

Personal Records surfaces your single best workout performance across 8 distinct categories for the selected year. It lives inside the Insights screen and pairs each record card with a live map showing the GPS route of that workout.

## User Experience

The section appears in Insights after the Workout Breakdown — it's only visible when you have at least one workout logged for the selected year.

A horizontally scrollable grid (2 rows, with a peek of the next column to encourage scrolling) displays all 8 record cards at once. Each card shows:

- An icon and category name
- Your record value (e.g. pace, calories, distance)
- The date the record was set

Tapping a card selects it — it gets a coloured border and scales up slightly. The map directly below the grid updates to show the route for that workout, with a polyline drawn in the record's accent colour, a start annotation with the workout type icon, and a finish flag. If a workout has no GPS route, a "No route available" placeholder is shown instead.

A context sentence above the map updates with each selection — for example, "Your fastest pace was 5:12 /km" — and the workout details (type, date, duration, distance, calories, weather) are shown in the map footer.

<Note>
  Values display "--" for any category where no data is available (for example, if your workouts didn't record heart rate, the Max Heart Rate card will show "--").

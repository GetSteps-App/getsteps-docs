## Overview

The hourly steps chart appears on the home screen when you are in Daily view mode. It breaks down your step activity into 24 one-hour bars, so you can see exactly when during the day you were most active.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="24-Hour Bar Chart">
    Each of the 24 bars represents one hour of the day, from midnight (0:00) to 11 PM (23:00). Taller bars mean more steps during that hour.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Color Coding">
    All bars share the same color for the selected day. If your total steps met or exceeded your goal for that day, the bars appear green. If not, they appear blue. This gives you an instant sense of whether it was a goal day.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Axis Labels">
    The horizontal axis shows time labels at 0:00, 6:00, 12:00, and 18:00 so you can quickly orient yourself. The vertical axis shows step count values with grid lines for reference.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Animated Updates">
    When you tap a different day in the calendar strip, the chart animates smoothly to reflect the new day's hourly data.

## Overview

The Workout Flight Ticket is a boarding pass-styled card in the Insights screen that gives you a stylised summary of all your workouts for the year. It uses airline ticket visual language — a route, a perforated tear line, and a QR code — to make your yearly fitness feel like a journey worth celebrating.

It only appears in Insights when you have at least one workout recorded for the selected year.

## User Experience

The ticket sits at the top of the Workouts section in Insights, directly after the "Workouts" section header.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Header">
    "BOARDING PASS" in a small caption and "[YEAR] FITNESS" as the headline, with an animated airplane icon on the right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route">
    "JAN" on the left (START) and "DEC" on the right (FINISH), with a flight-path graphic in between: a dot, a line, a dumbbell icon, another line, and a dot. Your total workout count for the year is labelled below the path in orange.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stats">
    Three columns beneath the route show your yearly totals at a glance — DURATION, DISTANCE, and BURNED (calories). Values scale automatically to fit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stub">
    A perforated tear line separates the main ticket from the boarding stub. The stub shows a rotating motivational boarding message on the left (e.g. "READY FOR TAKEOFF 🛫", "FIRST CLASS FITNESS ✨", "CLEARED FOR GAINS 💪") and the Steps app icon, "GetSteps.app" label, and a scannable QR code on the right.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The QR code links to [getsteps.app](https://getsteps.app) and is generated on-device. It adapts automatically to light and dark mode.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Total Workouts" icon="dumbbell">
    The total number of workouts you completed during the year, displayed prominently along the flight path.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Duration" icon="clock">
    Your combined workout time for the year, shown as hours and minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Distance" icon="route">
    Total distance covered across all workouts, in km or miles based on your unit system.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  The boarding message in the stub rotates based on your total workout count, so it will vary from year to year as your activity level changes.

## Overview

Color Themes lets you personalise the colour of your step goal progress indicators throughout the app — progress rings, bars, calendar dots, and home screen widgets. Choose from a set of named preset palettes, or define your own custom colours using the system colour picker. Changes apply instantly everywhere.

## User Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Color Themes">
    Go to Settings and tap "Color Theme". A sheet slides up showing all available options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a Preset">
    A vertical list of preset rows is shown, each with two coloured circles (your in-progress colour and your completed colour), the preset name, and a checkmark on the currently active selection. Tapping any preset applies it immediately.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Custom Colours">
    The "Custom" row at the bottom, when selected, expands inline to reveal two colour pickers — one for "In Progress" and one for "Completed". Any colour you pick is saved and applied in real time.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Every change — whether selecting a preset or adjusting a custom colour — reloads all your home screen widgets instantly so they stay in sync.

## How It Works

<Tip>
  Custom colours are saved as persistent preferences — they'll be remembered even if you switch to a preset and back.

## Pro Features

<Warning>
  Color Themes requires a **Pro subscription**. Non-Pro users who attempt to apply a non-default theme will be shown the upgrade screen.
</Warning>

The Color Themes row is visible in Settings for all users, but applying any theme other than the default requires Steps Pro.

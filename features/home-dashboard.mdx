## Overview

The home screen is your primary view in the Steps app. It brings together your step count card, a chart of your activity, and a date navigator into one scrollable layout — giving you a complete picture of your movement at a glance.

<Tip>Tap any day in the calendar strip at the bottom to instantly load that day's step data and chart.</Tip>

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Step Count Card">
    The top of the screen shows your step count for the selected day, along with distance, calories, and flights climbed. Swipe left or right on the card to move between days, weeks, or months.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Activity Chart">
    Below the card, a chart visualizes your steps over time. In Daily mode you see an hourly breakdown. Switch to Weekly or Monthly for a broader view of your trends.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Date Navigator">
    A scrollable calendar strip at the bottom lets you jump to any date. The selected period stays in sync with both the card and the chart above it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Header & Weather">
    The top-left of the screen shows either your current weather conditions (temperature and condition) or a time-based greeting — "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening". You can enable or disable weather in Settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Period Picker">
    Switch between Daily, Weekly, and Monthly views using the period picker. Each mode changes how the card, chart, and calendar strip display your data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Smart Refresh

The home screen keeps your data current automatically:

- When you return to the app, today's step count and greeting refresh instantly.
- A significant time change (like midnight) resets the view back to today.

<Note>If you reach your daily step goal, the app may prompt you to rate Steps on the App Store — thank you for your support!</Note>

## Pro Features

<Note>Weekly and Monthly chart views require a Steps Pro subscription. Attempting to select them without Pro will show the upgrade screen. The Daily view is always free.</Note>

## Overview

Streaks track how many consecutive days you have met your daily step goal. A flame badge on the step count card shows your current count, and tapping it opens a detailed sheet with stats, a heatmap calendar, and milestone trophies.

## Flame Badge

The flame badge sits in the top-left corner of the step count card:

- **Orange flame** — your streak is active (1 or more days)
- **Grey flame** — your streak is at zero

Tap the badge at any time to open the Streaks detail sheet.

## Streaks Detail Sheet

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hero Section">
    The top of the sheet shows your current milestone trophy on the left and your streak day count in large text on the right. Below it you'll see your average daily steps and total steps accumulated during this streak.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Today's Progress">
    A progress bar shows how far you are from locking in today's streak day. Once your goal is reached it switches to a green "Day N locked in" confirmation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="30-Day Heatmap">
    A calendar grid covers the past 30 days. Each cell is color-coded by intensity:
    - **Green** — goal reached
    - **Blue gradient** — steps recorded but goal not reached
    - **Grey** — no steps recorded

    Tap any cell to see that day's step count, distance, calories, and goal ring in a detail card at the top of the sheet.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Milestone Trophies">
    Seven milestone tiers reward your consistency. Each tier has a unique trophy badge that unlocks when your streak reaches the required number of days.

    | Tier | Days Required |
    |---|---|
    | Bronze | 7 |
    | Silver | 14 |
    | Gold | 30 |
    | Platinum | 60 |
    | Emerald | 100 |
    | Ruby | 200 |
    | Diamond | 365 |

    Earned badges appear in full color; unearned badges are greyed out. The next milestone card shows how many days remain until your next trophy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Personal Best">
    A dedicated line shows your longest-ever streak and the date range it spanned, highlighted in purple.

## How Streaks Are Calculated

- A day counts toward your streak only after you reach your step goal for that day.
- Missing a full day's goal breaks your streak and resets it to zero.
- Your goal is evaluated against whatever goal was active on each specific date — so changing your goal does not retroactively break past streak days.
- Today's streak day is counted the moment you hit your goal, so the badge updates in real time.

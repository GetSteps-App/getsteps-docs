## Overview

Steps supports a wide range of HealthKit workout types and presents each with a consistent icon, color, and name throughout the app — in the workout list, activity rows, detail view headers, share images, and the Live Activity widget.

## Startable Workouts

These are the workout types you can begin directly in Steps:

| Activity | Icon Style | Color |
|---|---|---|
| Outdoor Running | Running figure | Purple |
| Indoor Running | Treadmill | Purple |
| Outdoor Walking | Walking figure | Blue |
| Indoor Walking | Treadmill (walking) | Blue |
| Outdoor Cycling | Bicycle | Green |
| Indoor Cycling | Stationary bike | Green |
| Hiking | Hiker | Mint |

## Activity History Types

Steps reads a broader set of workout types from your Apple Health history. In addition to the startable types above, these activity types appear in your records when imported from HealthKit:

Swimming, HIIT, Strength Training, Yoga, Pilates, Elliptical, Rowing, Dance, Racket Sports, and more — 23 named types in total. Any type not in this list is grouped under **Other**.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consistent Colors" icon="palette">
    Each workout type has a fixed color used everywhere in the app — route polylines, stat card accents, share images, and the Live Activity widget all use the same color for a given activity.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Indoor vs. Outdoor Icons" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Walking, running, and cycling each have distinct icons for their indoor and outdoor variants, making it easy to tell them apart at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Smart Metrics" icon="gauge">
    Each activity type maps to the correct HealthKit quantity types for distance and speed. For example, cycling uses cycling distance and cycling speed, while walking and running share the walking/running distance type.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Activity List Filtering" icon="filter">
    Only the four outdoor-friendly types (walking, running, cycling, hiking) appear in the Activity List. All other types are tracked in Health history but kept out of the activity feed.

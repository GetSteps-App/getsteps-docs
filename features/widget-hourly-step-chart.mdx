The Hourly Step Chart widget displays a bar chart of your step counts broken down by hour for the current day. At a glance you can see exactly when during the day you were most active.

## How It Works

The widget renders as a medium-size Home Screen widget. A header row shows today's date, your total distance on the left, and your total step count on the right. Below the header, a full-width bar chart covers every hour from midnight through the current hour. Bar heights animate smoothly as new step data arrives throughout the day.

## User Experience

- Add the widget to your Home Screen in medium size.
- The date header is formatted as "Mon, Jun 21" style for quick day-at-a-glance context.
- Distance is shown in your preferred unit (km or miles).
- The step count animates with a numeric transition as live data updates.
- The widget refreshes every 30 minutes during active hours (6am–11pm) and every 2 hours overnight.

<Tip>
  Use the Hourly Step Chart to identify your peak activity windows and plan movement breaks around your naturally less-active hours.

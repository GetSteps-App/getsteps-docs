Steps automatically syncs your step data, workout records, and settings between your iPhone and Apple Watch. The sync is transparent — you never need to manually trigger it. Your watch always has the latest data whether you're on a run, at your desk, or away from your phone.

## How It Works

When your iPhone and Apple Watch are connected, data flows automatically in both directions. The watch sends live step readings it picks up directly from HealthKit; the iPhone sends back weekly records, monthly records, recent workouts, and your current settings. If the devices are out of range, the last received values are served from the watch's local cache so the app and complications stay populated.

## What Syncs

  <Card title="Step Data" icon="shoe-prints">
    Current steps, distance, and calories sync in real time when devices are connected. Weekly and monthly records sync so the watch charts always reflect your full history.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workouts" icon="figure-run">
    Your 5 most recent workouts sync from iPhone to watch and appear in the Workouts tab of the watch app.

  <Card title="Settings" icon="sliders">
    Your daily step goal, unit system (km or miles), week start day, step count display mode, and notification preferences all sync automatically when you change them on iPhone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Streak & Goal History" icon="fire">
    Your current streak count and historical goal changes sync to the watch so bar charts color each day against the goal that was actually active on that day.

## Watch Face Complications

Step count, distance, and calories are pushed directly to watch face complications so they update even when the watch app is not open. Complications refresh automatically as your step count changes throughout the day.

## User Experience

- Sync happens automatically — no manual action needed.
- Settings changes on iPhone (goal, units, week start) appear on the watch within seconds when in range.
- If your iPhone is temporarily out of range, the watch continues to read steps directly from its own HealthKit and shows the last synced records for weekly and monthly views.
- When the watch app becomes active, it immediately requests a fresh sync from the iPhone.

<Note>
  Watch connectivity works for all users at no cost. The data available on the watch reflects whatever you have access to on the iPhone side.

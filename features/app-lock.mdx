## Overview

App Lock uses Apple's Screen Time framework to block selected apps on your device until you reach your daily step goal. Once you hit your target, the selected apps unlock automatically and you receive a notification. Shields reset at midnight every day so the cycle starts fresh.

This is a Pro-only feature.

## User Experience

### First-Time Setup

When you first encounter App Lock, an intro sheet explains the feature with a scrolling row of social app icons (Twitter/X, Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, and more) and a brief description: "Take control of your screen time. Set daily limits for social apps and stay focused on what matters most."

### Settings

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open App Lock Settings">
    Go to Settings and tap "App Lock". The row shows your current status — "On" or "Off". A sheet slides up.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable App Lock">
    Toggle "Enable App Lock" on. If you're not a Pro user, this opens the upgrade screen instead. If you are Pro, iOS will ask for Screen Time permission — a spinner shows while the request is in progress.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Apps to Block">
    Once enabled, a "Select Apps" button appears. Tapping it opens the iOS system app picker where you can choose individual apps or entire categories to block. Your selections are listed below the button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Walk to Unlock">
    From this point on, your selected apps are blocked each morning. As you accumulate steps throughout the day, Steps monitors your progress. When you reach your goal, shields are removed automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Daily Behaviour

- Each morning at midnight, app shields are re-applied automatically.
- When your step count reaches your daily goal, all selected apps are unblocked instantly and you receive an "Apps Unlocked!" notification.
- If you lower your step goal below your current step count mid-day, the apps unlock immediately.
- If you disable App Lock entirely, shields are removed right away.

<Tip>
  App Lock works even when the Steps app is closed — the Screen Time framework enforces shields at the OS level.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  App Lock requires Screen Time to be enabled on your device. If Screen Time permission is denied, the app will guide you to enable it in iOS Settings.
</Warning>

## Pro Features

App Lock **requires a Pro subscription**. Tapping "Enable App Lock" without a Pro account opens the Steps Pro upgrade screen.

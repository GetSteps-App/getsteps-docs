## Overview

The Settings screen is your central hub for configuring the Steps app. It's accessible from the gear icon in the toolbar (iOS 26+) or from settings buttons throughout the app. Settings are grouped into three sections: App Settings, Support, and About.

If you're not yet a Pro user, a "Get Steps Pro" upgrade card appears at the top with a free trial CTA.

## How It Works

### App Settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Appearance">
    Choose between System (follows your device setting), Light, or Dark mode. The change applies instantly across the entire app.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Color Theme">
    Personalise the colour of your step progress indicators — rings, bars, calendar dots, and widgets. Choose from preset palettes or define your own custom colours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Unit System">
    Switch between Metric (km) and Imperial (miles). This updates the app, your home screen widgets, and your Apple Watch companion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week Starts On">
    Choose whether your week starts on Sunday or Monday. This affects the weekday breakdown in Insights and calendar views. Also syncs to your Apple Watch.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="View Steps By">
    Switch the main step chart between Daily, Weekly, or Monthly view. Weekly and Monthly views require a Pro subscription.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Daily Goal">
    Set an optional daily step target. A wheel picker lets you choose from 1,000 to 20,000 steps in increments of 500. An estimated distance equivalent is shown as you scroll.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App Lock">
    Block selected apps until you reach your daily step goal. Uses Apple's Screen Time framework. Requires a Pro subscription.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Notifications">
    Toggle push notifications. Enabling this requests permission from iOS. If permission was previously denied, the app opens iOS Settings so you can grant it manually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home Insight">
    Choose which metric is highlighted in the home screen insight card. Changes reload your widgets immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Show Weather">
    Toggle current weather display. Enabling this requests your location. Disabling it clears any cached location and weather data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App Icon">
    Change the Steps app icon on your home screen. A grid of available icon options is shown; tapping one applies it immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Home Screen Widgets">
    Manage your Steps home screen widgets and their configuration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App Language">
    Opens iOS Settings so you can change the app's display language.
  </Accordion>

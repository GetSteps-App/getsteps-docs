## Overview

The Activity List is your main hub for reviewing past workouts. It shows a chronologically grouped, filterable list of completed outdoor activities — walking, running, cycling, and hiking — most recent first.

## User Experience

1. Open the **Activity** tab. Your past workouts load automatically.
2. Workouts are grouped by month (e.g., "February 2026"), with the most recent at the top.
3. Use the filter controls to narrow the list by activity type:
   - On iOS 26 and later, a funnel icon in the toolbar opens a filter menu.
   - On earlier iOS versions, scrollable pill buttons appear at the top of the list.
4. Tap a filter pill to show only that activity type (Running, Walking, Cycling, or Hiking). The active pill highlights in the app's primary color.
5. On iOS 26+, tap the **+** button in the toolbar to start a new workout directly from the Activity tab.
6. Pull down to refresh and sync the latest workouts from HealthKit.
7. If no workouts exist — or none match the active filter — a contextual empty state appears with a relevant icon and message.

<Note>
  Only outdoor activity types (walking, running, cycling, hiking) appear in the Activity List. Other workout types recorded in the Health app are not shown here.

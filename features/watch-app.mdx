The Steps Apple Watch app is a standalone companion that shows today's steps, weekly and monthly summaries, and recent workouts — all without needing to reach for your iPhone. Data syncs automatically from your iPhone and is also read directly from HealthKit on the watch.

## How It Works

The app uses a vertical scrolling tab layout with four screens navigated by swiping up and down.

## The Four Tabs

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Today" icon="sun">
    Your current step count in a large serif font, with distance and calories in secondary text. When your daily goal is enabled, a horizontal progress bar shows your percentage toward the goal. The background color reflects how close you are to hitting it.
  </Card>
  <Card title="This Week" icon="calendar-week">
    Total steps for the week (or average steps per day if you prefer that display mode) in a large serif font, plus a 7-bar chart with weekday labels. Goal-achieved bars use the completed color, below-goal bars use the in-progress color, and future days appear as faint gray. A dashed line marks your step goal when enabled.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Month" icon="calendar">
    Total steps for the month and a compact heat-map calendar grid showing each day's activity level by color intensity — the same visual you see in the Monthly Calendar widget on iPhone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workouts" icon="figure-run">
    A scrollable list of your 5 most recent workouts synced from your iPhone. Each row shows the workout icon, activity name, duration, and a relative date ("Today", "Yesterday", or the abbreviated day and date).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Experience

- The watch app refreshes automatically whenever you raise your wrist to wake it and whenever the calendar day changes.
- Step data is read directly from HealthKit on the watch, so your count updates even when your iPhone is not nearby.
- Background delivery means new steps from HealthKit wake the app silently to keep your complications current.
- Settings changes on your iPhone (goal, unit system, week start preference) sync to the watch within seconds when in range, or on next connection.
- Watch face complications update automatically as your step count changes throughout the day.

<Note>
  All four tabs are available to all users at no cost. The streak view requires your daily step goal to be enabled to show meaningful data.

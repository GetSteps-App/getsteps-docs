The Weekly Step Chart widget displays a bar chart of your daily step counts for the current week. It's available in small and medium sizes and helps you spot which days you hit your goal and where you can improve consistency.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Small Size" icon="square">
    Shows a "This Week" label, your total step count in a large serif font, and a compact 7-bar chart with abbreviated weekday labels. Clean and minimal — perfect for a quick weekly check-in.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium Size" icon="rectangle-wide">
    Adds a detailed header with total steps and a "steps" unit label. The Y-axis shows step count markers in K-notation (e.g., "8K"), and a dashed goal line appears across the chart when your daily step goal is enabled.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Experience

- Bars for future days appear as very faint gray so the current week's progress stands out.
- Days with zero steps use a slightly darker gray.
- Days where you met your goal show a "goal completed" gradient; days below goal use the "in progress" gradient.
- Today's weekday label is bold; all other days are regular weight.
- The goal line automatically reflects any goal changes you made during the week — each day is compared against the goal that was active on that specific day.
- The widget refreshes every 60 minutes during active hours (6am–11pm) and every 2 hours overnight.

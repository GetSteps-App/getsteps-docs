Your daily goal is the step target you aim to hit each day. Meeting your goal builds your streak and unlocks milestone messages.

## Setting Your Goal

</Frame>

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Daily goal**
3. Use the scroll picker to choose between **1,000 and 20,000 steps** in increments of 500
4. Your estimated distance is shown below the picker based on your unit preference (km or mi)

## Milestone Tiers

As you adjust your goal, you'll see a milestone message indicating the difficulty level:

| Goal Range | Milestone | Icon |
|------------|-----------|------|
| 1,000 - 2,999 | Getting Started | Leaf |
| 3,000 - 4,999 | Building Momentum | Bolt |
| 5,000 - 7,999 | Good Daily Habit | Star |
| 8,000 - 9,999 | Active Lifestyle | Paperplane |
| 10,000 - 12,999 | Excellent Goal | Target |
| 13,000 - 15,999 | High Achiever | Trophy |
| 16,000 - 20,000 | Athletic Performance | Medal |

<Tip>Start with a goal you can consistently hit, then gradually increase it. Building a streak matters more than setting an ambitious target you can't maintain.</Tip>

## Goal and Streaks

Your daily goal directly affects your [streak](/features/streaks). Each day you reach your goal adds to your consecutive streak count. Missing your goal resets the streak.

If you change your goal mid-day:

- **Lowering** your goal: If your steps already exceed the new goal, the day counts as complete
- **Raising** your goal: You need to reach the new, higher target for the day to count

## Goal Progress

Your progress toward your daily goal is visible throughout Steps:

- **Home Dashboard** - Progress ring around the step card
- **Widgets** - Step count widgets show progress
- **Watch Complications** - Goal progress on your Apple Watch
- **App Lock** - Blocked apps unlock when you reach your goal

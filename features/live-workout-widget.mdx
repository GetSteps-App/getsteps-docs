## Overview

When you start a workout in Steps, a Live Activity automatically appears on your Lock Screen and in the Dynamic Island. It mirrors your in-app metrics in real time, so you can glance at your stats without ever unlocking your phone.

## User Experience

1. Start any workout in Steps. The Live Activity appears on your Lock Screen and Dynamic Island within moments.
2. The widget displays:
   - Your workout type icon and name
   - Elapsed time
   - Distance
   - Active energy (calories)
   - Pace or speed (depending on activity type)
3. Metrics update approximately every 2 seconds throughout your session.
4. When you end your workout, the widget transitions to a finished state and dismisses itself automatically after 60 seconds.
5. If Steps is closed unexpectedly mid-workout and you reopen it, the Live Activity resumes automatically alongside your recovered session.

<Note>
  If Live Activities are disabled in your iPhone's Settings, the widget is silently skipped and the workout continues normally in the app.

## Stale Detection

Each widget update sets a 15-second freshness window. If no new data arrives within that window (for example, if your phone loses connection to the app process), the system marks the widget as stale automatically.

## Pro Features

The Live Activity widget is available to every user. No Pro subscription required.

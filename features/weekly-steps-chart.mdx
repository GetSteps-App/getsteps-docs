## Overview

The weekly steps chart displays a bar for each day of the selected week, letting you spot patterns in your activity and compare days at a glance. It appears on the home screen when you switch to Weekly view mode.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="7-Day Bar Chart">
    Seven bars appear — one for each day of the selected week. The horizontal axis shows the day-of-month number for each bar so you always know which date you are looking at.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Goal Color Coding">
    Each bar is independently color-coded. Green means you met your step goal on that day; blue means you fell short. The app evaluates against the goal that was active on each specific date, so historical goal changes are respected.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tap to Select a Day">
    Tap any bar to select it. The selected bar highlights with a stroke outline while the others dim. The step count card above the chart instantly updates to show the detailed stats for that specific day — steps, distance, calories, and flights climbed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deselect">
    Tap the same bar again to deselect it. All bars return to full opacity and the card reverts to showing the week's overall totals or averages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Axis Labels">
    The selected day's label on the horizontal axis appears bold. The vertical axis abbreviates large values with "K" (for example, 8,000 steps shows as "8K").
  </Accordion>

<Tip>Use the sum/average toggle on the step count card to switch between the week's total steps and your daily average for the week.</Tip>

The Monthly Step Chart widget is a medium-size Home Screen widget that shows a bar chart covering every day of the current month. It gives you a high-level view of your monthly activity pattern and goal consistency.

## How It Works

A header row shows the current month and year (e.g., "Jun 2025"), your total distance for the month on the left, and your total step count on the right. Below the header, a bar chart renders one bar per day across the full month (28–31 bars depending on the month).

## User Experience

- X-axis labels appear on day 1 and every 5th day to keep the chart readable without crowding.
- Y-axis labels use K-notation (e.g., "8K") for step count reference points.
- Bar colors reflect goal achievement for each individual day:
  - Zero steps — light gray
  - Goal achieved — "goal completed" gradient
  - Below goal — "in progress" gradient
  - Goal disabled — always "in progress" gradient
- Each day is compared against the goal that was active on that specific day, so mid-month goal changes are respected accurately.
- The widget refreshes every 3 hours (monthly data changes slowly).

<Tip>
  Scroll through a few months to spot patterns — like which weeks you tend to fall short — and use that to plan more active days ahead.

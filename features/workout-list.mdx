## Overview

The Workout List is where you choose which type of workout to begin. Every supported activity appears as a card you can tap to start immediately. Requires iOS 26 or later.

## User Experience

1. Navigate to the **Workout** tab. The list of available workout types appears.
2. Each card shows:
   - The activity's icon in its designated color on the left.
   - The workout name (e.g., "Outdoor Running", "Indoor Walking") in semibold text.
   - An orange play button on the right.
3. Tap the **play button** on any card to begin that workout. A brief haptic confirms your tap, and the countdown screen appears immediately.
4. On iOS 26+, you can also start a workout from the **Activity tab** by tapping the **+** button in the toolbar — this skips the list and jumps straight to the countdown.

<Note>
  HealthKit authorization is requested the first time you visit the Workout tab. Steps needs permission to record workout data, route, energy, heart rate, and distance.

## Available Workouts

Steps supports 7 workout configurations across 4 activity types:

| Activity | Variants |
|---|---|
| Walking | Outdoor Walk, Indoor Walk |
| Running | Outdoor Run, Indoor Run |
| Cycling | Outdoor Cycle, Indoor Cycle |
| Hiking | Hike |

Indoor and outdoor variants use different icons to visually distinguish them (e.g., a treadmill icon vs. a running figure).

## How It Works

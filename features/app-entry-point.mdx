## Overview

When you open Steps for the first time, a brief onboarding flow guides you through granting HealthKit access and setting up your daily step goal. After that, the main app experience begins — with your step data, charts, and history all available from a simple tab-based navigation.

## First Launch

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Onboarding">
    On first launch, Steps presents an onboarding screen that walks you through:
    - Granting HealthKit read permission so Steps can access your step data
    - Setting your initial daily step goal

    Once onboarding is complete, the app transitions smoothly to the main interface.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Upgrade Screen">
    After onboarding, Steps may show the Pro upgrade screen once per app version, and then at most once every 7 days thereafter. Pro users never see the upgrade screen.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Language Suggestion">
    If your device is set to a language that Steps supports (beyond the default), a one-time suggestion sheet offers to switch the app to that language.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="App Lock Introduction">
    If you have not seen the App Lock feature introduction yet, a one-time sheet explains how to use step goals to lock and unlock the app.

## App Navigation

Steps is organized into tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|---|---|
| **Steps** | The home screen — your step count card, activity chart, and date navigator |
| **Activities** | Your workout history and activity summaries |
| **Insights** | Trends, averages, and deeper analysis of your step data |
| **History** | Full calendar and list view of past step records (pre-iOS 26 only) |
| **Settings** | Goal, units, notifications, appearance, and more (pre-iOS 26 only) |

On iOS 26 and later, the tab bar collapses as you scroll down to give more room to content. History and Settings are accessible from toolbar buttons on the home screen instead of separate tabs.

<Tip>Tapping the active Steps tab resets the view to today's data. This is a quick way to return to the current day from any selected date.</Tip>

## Deep Links

Steps supports deep links that open directly to a specific workout. If you tap a notification about a completed workout, the app navigates straight to that workout's detail view.

## Background Refresh

Steps refreshes your step data silently in the background, even when the app is not open. This keeps your home screen widget current and ensures goal achievement notifications arrive promptly.

## Automatic Updates

When the clock rolls past midnight, Steps resets the home screen to today and refreshes your welcome message — so you always start a new day with a fresh view.

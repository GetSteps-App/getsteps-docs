Steps integrates with Siri so you can check your daily step count using voice commands without opening the app.

## Available Shortcut

### Today's Steps

Ask Siri for your current step count. Steps will respond with your total steps for today.

## How to Use

- "How many steps today in Steps"
- "What's my step count in Steps"
- "Show my steps from Steps"

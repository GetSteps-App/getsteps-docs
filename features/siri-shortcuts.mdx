Steps integrates with Siri and the Shortcuts app so you can check your step count hands-free or build powerful automations that branch on how active you've been today.

## How It Works

Steps exposes a "Get Today's Steps" action that returns your current step count as a spoken Siri response and as a usable value in any Shortcuts automation. The action runs silently in the background without opening the app.

## User Experience

- After installing Steps, Siri automatically learns the shortcut phrases and surfaces them as suggestions on your device.
- Ask Siri any natural phrasing such as:
  - "Hey Siri, get my steps from Steps"
  - "How many steps have I taken in Steps?"
  - "How far have I walked in Steps?"
  - "How am I doing in Steps?"
- Siri responds with your current count: "You have 7,432 steps today."
- In the Shortcuts app, find the **Get Today's Steps** action under the Steps app and add it to any shortcut.

## Example Automations

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Conditional Messaging" icon="message">
    "If steps is greater than 8,000, send a congratulations message to a friend."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Daily Summary" icon="list-check">
    "Every evening at 9pm, get today's steps and log it to a note or spreadsheet."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  The step count returned by the Shortcuts action is a plain number, so you can use it with any math, comparison, or text operation in your automation.

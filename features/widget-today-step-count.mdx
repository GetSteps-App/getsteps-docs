The Today Step Count widget is the primary home screen widget for Steps, showing your current step count in real-time along with distance and calorie data. It supports multiple sizes including Lock Screen and Dynamic Island complications.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Home Screen (Small)" icon="mobile">
    A large step count is centered on the widget with distance above and calories below. A progress arc traces around the widget border as you accumulate steps toward your daily goal. The background gradient shifts from in-progress to goal-completed color when you hit your goal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Lock Screen" icon="lock">
    Three Lock Screen variants are available: a rectangular view with step count, distance, and calories; an inline single-line summary; and a circular gauge showing goal progress with your step count.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Experience

- Add the widget to your Home Screen or Lock Screen via the standard iOS widget picker.
- Your current step count is displayed prominently, with distance and calories as secondary metrics.
- The progress arc around the widget edge fills as your steps accumulate toward your daily goal.
- If you have enabled motivational messages, a short encouraging phrase replaces the calories row.
- The widget refreshes every 15 minutes during active hours (7am–10pm) and every 60 minutes overnight.

## Widget Sizes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Small (Home Screen)">
    Large step count centered, distance above, calories below. A progress arc overlays the widget border using a linear gradient background. The step count uses a serif typeface for a clean, readable look.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Rectangular (Lock Screen)">
    Shows a "Today steps" label, your step count on the left, and distance and calories stacked on the right.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inline (Lock Screen)">
    A compact single-line view showing step count, distance, calories, and a walk icon — ideal for always-on displays.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Circular (Lock Screen)">
    A circular gauge showing your goal progress with a shoe emoji and step count. Falls back to a plain count display if the daily goal is disabled.

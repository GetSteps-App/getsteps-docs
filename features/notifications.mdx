Steps delivers timely local notifications to keep you motivated throughout the day. There are four notification types: goal achievement alerts, halfway-point milestone nudges, workout completion summaries, and app-unlock alerts when step-gated blocking is lifted.

## Notification Types

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Goal Achieved" icon="trophy">
    Fires when you reach your daily step goal while the app is in the background. The title is randomly chosen from six congratulatory variants (e.g., "Goal Crushed!", "On Fire!"). If you exceeded your goal, the message also shows how many bonus steps you walked.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Halfway There" icon="flag">
    Fires when you reach approximately 50% of your daily goal. The message shows your current step count, how many steps remain, and your progress percentage — a gentle nudge to keep moving.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Workout Complete" icon="figure-run">
    Fires after a workout session ends. The title is specific to the activity (e.g., "Run Complete!", "Ride Complete!") and the body includes your total duration and distance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Apps Unlocked" icon="lock-open">
    Fires when your step-gated app blocking is lifted because you reached your daily goal. Lets you know immediately that your blocked apps are available again.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Experience

- On the first relevant trigger, iOS prompts you to allow notifications from Steps.
- Notification titles are randomly selected from a pool of variants so messages feel fresh rather than repetitive.
- Tapping a goal notification shows a "View Steps" action that brings Steps to the foreground.
- Tapping a workout notification shows a "View Workout" action that opens the workout detail screen.
- Each notification type fires at most once per day (or once per workout for workout completions), preventing duplicate alerts.
- At midnight, outdated notification tracking data from previous days is cleaned up automatically.

## Managing Notifications

If you declined the permission prompt, you can re-enable notifications at any time:

1. Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone.
2. Scroll to **Steps** and tap **Notifications**.
3. Enable **Allow Notifications**.

Alternatively, go to **Settings** inside the Steps app and toggle notifications on — if permission was previously denied, the app will take you directly to the system settings page.

<Note>
  Notifications are free and available to all users, subject to system permission being granted.

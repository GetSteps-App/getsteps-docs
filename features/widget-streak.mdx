The Streak widget shows your current consecutive-days-goal-met streak alongside a 7-day week view, today's step count versus your goal, and a progress gauge. It's available in small and medium sizes and requires your daily step goal to be enabled.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Small Size" icon="square">
    A flame icon with your streak count sits at the top. Below it, 7 compact day icons show each day's achievement status for the week. A divider separates that from today's step count vs. goal text and a linear progress gauge.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium Size" icon="rectangle-wide">
    A large step count and goal appear on the left with your streak count and flame icon on the right. A progress gauge sits below, then a full 7-day row with abbreviated weekday labels and larger day icons.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Experience

Each day in the weekly row shows one of three states:

- **Achieved** — a filled checkmark circle in the "goal completed" gradient color.
- **Today (in progress)** — a faint filled circle with a partial arc overlay showing your current progress percentage.
- **Future** — a subtle quaternary-filled circle indicating days not yet reached.

Today's weekday label is bold; all other days use regular weight. The background gradient intensity reflects how close you are to today's goal.

<Warning>
  If your daily step goal is disabled, both widget sizes show a placeholder message: "Enable step goal to see your streak." Turn on the daily step goal in app settings to activate the streak widget.
</Warning>

The widget refreshes every hour.

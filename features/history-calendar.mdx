## Overview

The History screen gives you a full view of your past step data. Browse by month in a color-coded calendar grid, or switch to a chronological list. Tap any day to see its detailed stats — steps, distance, calories, and goal progress.

## Opening History

- **iOS 26+**: Tap the calendar icon in the home screen toolbar. History opens as a sheet.
- **Earlier iOS**: History is always accessible from the History tab in the tab bar.

## Calendar View

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monthly Grid">
    Months are displayed as full calendar grids stacked vertically, with the most recent month at the bottom. Each month shows its name and year as a header, followed by weekday column letters and a grid of day cells.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Day Cell Colors">
    Each day cell is color-coded based on your step goal progress for that day:
    - **Green** — goal reached
    - **Blue (partial opacity)** — steps recorded but goal not reached
    - **Full blue** — steps recorded with goal tracking disabled
    - **Light grey** — no data recorded

    Today's date number is shown in bold. Future dates are dimmed and not tappable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tap a Day for Details">
    Tap any day cell to select it. A detail card animates in at the top of the screen showing that day's steps, distance, calories, and a goal progress ring. Tap the X button or tap the same cell again to dismiss it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Jump to Latest">
    If you scroll up through older months and the current month goes off-screen, a "Jump to latest ↓" button appears at the bottom of the screen. Tap it to scroll back to the most recent month instantly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Month Jump">
    Use the month picker in the toolbar (iOS 26+) or the scrollable pill selector (earlier iOS) to jump directly to any available month.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## List View

Switch to List mode to see all recorded days for the selected month as a vertical list, sorted most-recent-first. Each row shows the date, step count, distance, calories, and a goal progress ring.

Toggle between Calendar and List view using the toolbar menu (iOS 26+) or the icon button in the header bar.

<Tip>Your week start day (Sunday or Monday) is respected in the calendar grid. Change this preference in Settings.</Tip>

## Pro Features

<Note>Free users can view the **3 most recent months** of history. **Steps Pro** unlocks your complete history going back up to 12 months.</Note>

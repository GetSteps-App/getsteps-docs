## Overview

The App Icon Selector lets you change the Steps app icon on your home screen to one of several hand-crafted alternate designs. It's accessible from Settings under the "App icon" row, which also shows the name of your currently active icon.

## User Experience

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Selector">
    In Settings, tap the "App icon" row. A sheet slides up showing a title, subtitle, and a grid of all available icon options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse Icons">
    Icons are displayed in a 4-column grid. Each icon appears as a 64×64 rounded square — the same shape as your home screen. Your currently active icon has a blue border and is scaled up slightly to make it easy to spot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Tap to Apply">
    Tap any icon to apply it immediately. The app switches to the new icon without restarting — iOS may show a brief system notification confirming the change.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credits">
    A "Credits & Disclaimer" section below the grid attributes the icon designs to their creators.
  </Step>
</Steps>

While the icon change is being applied, all buttons are temporarily disabled to prevent double-taps. If the change fails for any reason, an alert appears with the error details.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Instant Apply" icon="bolt">
    Tapping an icon applies it immediately via iOS's built-in alternate icon system. No app restart needed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Selection Indicator" icon="circle-check">
    The active icon has a blue 3pt border and a slight scale-up (1.05x) with a spring animation, making it easy to identify at a glance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Light & Dark Variants" icon="circle-half-stroke">
    Icons automatically use the appropriate asset for your current light or dark mode setting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Home Screen Sync" icon="mobile">
    The Settings row updates its trailing label to reflect the currently active icon name whenever you return to Settings.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  The icon you choose persists across app updates — iOS remembers your alternate icon selection automatically.

## Overview

When enabled, the home screen header shows your current weather conditions alongside your step data — so you can plan your walk or run without leaving the app. Weather data is powered by Apple WeatherKit and refreshes automatically each time you open Steps.

## How It Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Weather Header">
    When weather is enabled and your location is available, the top-left of the home screen displays:
    - A short condition label (e.g., "Mostly Cloudy")
    - A matching weather emoji (e.g., ⛅)
    - The current temperature in your preferred unit (°C or °F)

    If weather is unavailable or disabled, a time-based greeting appears instead — "Good morning", "Good afternoon", or "Good evening".
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Automatic Refresh">
    Weather updates each time you return to the app from the background, so the conditions shown are always current without any manual action on your part.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Temperature Units">
    Temperature is displayed in whichever unit system you have selected in Settings — Celsius or Fahrenheit.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Enabling Weather

Go to **Settings** and toggle on **Show Weather**. Steps will request location permission if it has not been granted yet. Weather requires both location access and device support for Apple WeatherKit.

<Note>A small "Apple Weather Legal" attribution link appears below the weather conditions. This is required by Apple's WeatherKit terms of service. Tapping "Legal" opens Apple's official attribution page.</Note>

## Availability

Weather display is available to all users at no cost. No Pro subscription is required.

The Monthly Step Calendar widget renders the current month as a compact calendar grid on your Home Screen. Each day cell is color-coded by activity level, giving you an instant visual heat-map of your monthly consistency.

## How It Works

The widget displays as a small Home Screen widget. A month and year header (e.g., "Jun 2025") sits above a 7-column grid of rounded cells — one per calendar day. The color intensity of each cell encodes how much activity you logged that day.

## User Experience

- **No data** — cell appears as faint transparent gray.
- **Partial progress** — cell fills with the "in progress" color at an opacity proportional to how close you got to your goal.
- **Goal reached** — cell shows a solid "goal completed" color (or solid "in progress" if goal tracking is disabled).
- Today's cell is outlined with a subtle orange-red stroke so you can always find the current day instantly.
- Empty cells before the first day and after the last day of the month are fully transparent.
- Week start (Sunday or Monday) follows your preference set in the app.
- The widget refreshes every 2 hours.

<Tip>
  The color heat-map makes it easy to spot streaks and gaps at a glance — solid color runs mean consistent days, while faint or gray patches highlight where you fell short.

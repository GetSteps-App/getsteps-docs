## Overview

Fun Equivalents transforms your raw yearly step and workout numbers into narrative comparisons that make your achievements feel tangible and fun. Instead of just seeing "4,200,000 steps", you might learn that you walked the distance from New York to LA and burned 2,340 slices of pizza.

This section appears twice inside the Insights screen — once for your daily walking stats and once for your workout-specific stats.

## User Experience

After your metric cards, a styled text block appears with two sentences stacked on top of each other, set against a transparent background with large faded emoji watermarks in each corner.

**Walking Fun Equivalents** (distance, calories, CO₂ saved, body fat burned):
- First sentence: combines your distance equivalent and calories equivalent — for example, "This year, you walked **the distance from New York to LA**, and burned **2,340 slices of pizza**!"
- Second sentence: combines CO₂ and body fat — for example, "You also saved **12 trees worth of CO₂**, and burned **1.2 kg of body fat**."

**Workout Fun Equivalents** (shown lower in Insights, only when you have workouts):
- First sentence: compares your total workout time to something pop-culture — for example, how many movies you could have watched.
- Second sentence: contextualises your total workout distance.

The intro phrase for each sentence rotates through multiple variants based on your total step or workout count, so the wording feels fresh across different activity levels and years.

## How It Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Distance Equivalent" icon="earth-americas">
    Your total yearly walking distance compared to a real-world journey (e.g. city-to-city distances).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calories Equivalent" icon="pizza-slice">
    Calories burned expressed as everyday food items — slices of pizza, chocolate bars, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CO₂ Saved" icon="leaf">
    An estimate of the CO₂ emissions you avoided by walking instead of driving.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Body Fat Burned" icon="fire-flame-curved">
    Your calories burned translated into approximate body fat in kilograms.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workout Duration" icon="film">
    Total workout time compared to a pop-culture reference, like the number of feature films you could have watched.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workout Distance" icon="road">
    Your total workout distance contextualised with a geographic or everyday comparison.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  The key values — distance, calories, CO₂, body fat, workout time, and workout distance — are displayed in a larger bold font within each sentence so they stand out at a glance.

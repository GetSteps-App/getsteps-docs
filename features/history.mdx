The History tab lets you browse your daily step records over time using a calendar view or chronological list.

## Calendar View

{/* TODO: Screenshot of history calendar view with color-coded days */}
<Frame caption="History calendar view showing daily goal completion">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/history-calendar.jpg" alt="History calendar view" />
</Frame>

The calendar displays each day with a color-coded indicator showing your progress:

- **Goal met** - Highlighted in your completed theme color
- **Partial progress** - Lighter shade based on percentage completed
- **No data** - No highlight

Navigate between months using the arrow buttons at the top of the calendar.

## List View

{/* TODO: Screenshot of history list view with daily records */}
<Frame caption="History list view with step counts and goal indicators">
  <img src="/images/screenshots/history-list.jpg" alt="History list view" />
</Frame>

Switch to list view to see your daily records in a scrollable list, showing:

- Date
- Step count
- Distance
- Whether you met your goal

## Month Navigation

Use the month navigation controls to jump between months. Each month shows a summary of your activity for that period.

The History tab lets you browse your daily step records over time using a calendar view or chronological list.

## Calendar View

The calendar displays each day with a color-coded indicator showing your progress:

- **Goal met** - Highlighted in your completed theme color
- **Partial progress** - Lighter shade based on percentage completed
- **No data** - No highlight

Navigate between months using the arrow buttons at the top of the calendar.

## List View

Switch to list view to see your daily records in a scrollable list, showing:

- Date
- Step count
- Distance
- Whether you met your goal

## Month Navigation

Use the month navigation controls to jump between months. Each month shows a summary of your activity for that period.
